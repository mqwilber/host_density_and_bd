# Host density has limited effects on pathogen invasion, disease-induced declines, and within-host infection dynamics across a landscape of disease

The repository contains the code and data for analyses on how *R. sierrae* density 
affects disease outcomes following invasion by the fungal pathogen *Bd*.  The computing environment necessary for reproducing the analyses performed in this manuscript can be reproduced by building and activating the conda environment defined in the `environment.yml` file.  See [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) for information on how to build a conda environment.
